# Waterfall
find which walls have the most water trapped in it
every number is an adjacent vertical pipe with a width of 1


## input 
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4] -> heights

## output
[2, 6, 5] -> [index, index, total-water]

## high-strategy
find the tips of the wells, and count the lesser values 
in between

## process



const waterwalls = () => {
	// highs = [];
	// current high
	// current low

	// if change of current high, current low becomes changed


  // possibly like sorting algos,
  // start with highest, until find val
    with same height

  // find the highest values on the sides
    // and look in
    // subset within highest values with peaks
